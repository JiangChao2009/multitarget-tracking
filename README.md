# Multitarget tracking

A multi target tracker based on Gaussian Mixture Probability Density Hypothesis Density Filter using Determinantal Point Processes pruning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- CMake 2.8 or newer
- OpenCV 3.4 (DNN library is required)
- Eigen 3.2

### Installating

Download the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/fjorquerauribe/multitarget-tracking.git
```

Build the project:
```
cd multitarget-tracking
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running the test

Download the MOT Challenge datasets https://motchallenge.net/

Create a symbolic link to the MOT Challenge datasets folder:
```
ln -s path/to/datasets/ data
```

Copy script to run Gaussian Mixture PHD filter:
```
cp ../scripts/start_gm_phd.sh .
```

Example: run Gaussian Mixture PHD filter over MOT16-02 sequence with public detections:
```
./start_gm_phd.sh MOT16 train MOT16-02 public 1
```

Example 2: run PHD filter and YOLO detector over MOT16-02 sequence (we assume YOLO .cfg, .weights and .names files are into data/yolo folder) 
```
./start_phd.sh MOT16 train MOT16-02 100 yolo 0.5
```
